        <h3><a href="https://github.com/peteryao/angelhack2015_sv" target="_blank">mailSift</a></h3>
        <p>MailSift was a hackathon project for AngelHack Silicon Valley 2015.  mailSift was a web  application aimed towards small businesses and startups which allowed users to link their email account to the application, allowing emails to be pre-sorted based on the tone of the message.  Postive emails were given a higher score, while more negative toned messages were given a lower score.  Users could also define keywords which would sort emails into catagories based on the number of times the keyword appeared in an email.   
        <br>
        Technologies used on this project were a Django based backend and HP Haven OnDemand for the sentiment analysis of emails.  This project won the HP sponser prize for best use of HP Idol OnDemand.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="" target="_blank">Spot</a></h3>
        <p>Spot was a hackathon project for AngelHack San Fransico 2015.  Unfortunately, Spot was never finished.  The goal of Spot was to create a web application which allowed users to find and connect with others to achive fitness goals.  Users could set their 'home' gym, and see all other users that frequent that gym.
        <br/>
        Technolgoies used on this project were a Django based backend and a simple HTML/CSS front end. Googe Place API was used as a method to find a list of gyms based on zip code.</p>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="" target="_blank">Story App</a></h3>
        <p>Story App is a placeholder name for a mobile application I am working on.  Story App is a simple writing prompt app, allowing a group of users to submit one sentence to the prompt, thus furthering the story.
        <br/>
        The main purpose of Story App is one of learning and discovery.  I am using this project as a way to learn Swift, as well as practice with working with real time data via Firebase.</p>
